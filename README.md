With this plugin you can surround words or sentences with a simple command in vim

for example we have a sentence : **Hello world** 

if i want to surround it with ***double quotation*** marks, i start by placing my cursor on the word and i will use the ***yss"*** command

***yss"*** = ***"Hello world"***

And i can also use the command to add ***brackets, parenthesis ***and*** many others***, using yss and then the symbols with which i want to surround my sentences

***yss]*** = ***[Hello world]***

***yss)*** = ***(Hello world)***
